Install opencv in Windows:
  1. Download Visual Studio 2017 (Commnity version works)
  2. Download CMake (https://cmake.org/download/)
  3. Download opencv and opencv_contrib from GitHub (https://github.com/opencv)
  4. Create a directory: 'opencv-*.*.*' (*.*.* is opencv version. For ex: 3.4.3)
  5. Create two subfolders:
      - 'opencv-*.*.*/build'
      - 'opencv-*.*.*/sources'
  6. Extract opencv and opencv_contrib to 'opencv-*.*.*/sources' directory.
      - 'opencv_*.*.*/sources/opencv'
      - 'opencv_*.*.*/sources/opencv_contrib'
  7. Open CMake and set the following variables:
      - source code: 'opencv_*.*.*/sources/opencv'
      - build the binaries: 'opencv_*.*.*/build'
      * Now click 'Configure'
  8. Set the following variables:
      - OPENCV_EXTRA_MODULES_PATH: 'opencv_*.*.*/sources/opencv_contrib/modules'
      - OPENCV_ENABLE_NONFREE: check
      - BUILD_opencv_contrib_world: check
  9. Now click 'Generate' and set the following variables:
      - Set the generator to 'Visual Studio 15 2017' (the default options)
  10. Open 'opencv_*.*.*/build/OpenCV.sln' with 'Visual Studio 2017' (It will take some time)
  11. Change solution configuration to 'Release' and set solution platform to 'Win32'/'Win64'.
  12. Build the following files in the same order: (right click on the file and click build)
      1. INSTALL
      2. ALL_BUILD
      3. opencv_python2
